AutomatedSegmentation folder contains the scripts needed to segment eve stripes automatically. It is particularly useful
when eve stripes are well defined.

ManualSegmentation folder contains the scripts needed to segment eve stripes mannually. It is particularly useful
when eve stripes are not well separated from the background.

ManualSegmentationTest generates segmentation movies from CompiledParticles datasets.
The outcome of this code is located in the Zenodo dataset 
“Unified bursting strategies in ectopic and endogenous even-skipped expression patterns - Supplemental Data” 
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7204096). Path: Movies/[Genotype]/Segmentation.
