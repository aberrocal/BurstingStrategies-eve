_DataSubmission folder contains the correct structure and the data to re-run the MATLAB code used in  Unified bursting strategies 
in ectopic and endogenous even-skipped expression patterns by Berrocal et al. 
_DataSubmission contains a folder called CompiledParticles, with the folder structure required for the analysis, 
but without CompiledParticles files. These files must be downloded separatedly, due to their large size.
